# dotfiles

## How to use
The nvim and zsh folders go in .config, and the contents of the bash/global folder are moved to /etc (or
elsewhere if you wish.)


## Requirements for vim changes

Now that I am using neovim there is no need for manual plugin installation

Vim Requires powerline fonts, and lua for the plugins to function correctly
Also the following plugins:
