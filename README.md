# dotfiles

## How to use
Everything except the i3 folder goes in your home directory, while i3 goes into your ~/.config folder
or you may use the automated installer if you wish

## Requirements for .Xresources
For fonts pertaining to rofi and Urxvt, you need the [Ofice Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro) fonts
Obviously you will need rofi and Urxvt for the .Xresources changes to apply to them

## Requirements for vim changes
Vim Requires powerline fonts, and lua for the plugins to function correctly
Also the following plugins:
[Pathogen by tpope](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) (Required for all below plugins)
[Supertab by ervandew](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)
[Vim-Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
[Neocomplete by Shougo](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim)
[NERDTree by scrooloose](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
[NERDTRee-tabs by jistr](https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs)
[Vim-litecorrect by reedes](https://github.com/reedes/vim-litecorrect)

If any plugin author wishes me to do so, I will remove my .vim folder from the repo

## NOTE
Anyone wishing to fork any of my dotfiles, feel free to create a seperate branch, if the changes are something that I would find use of and actually use in my workflow, I will integrate it into the master branch with your permission
